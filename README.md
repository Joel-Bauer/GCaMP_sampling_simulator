# GCaMP_sampling_simulator

In this repo i want to simulate the signal of different calcium indicators, and the quality of signal sampling at different sampling frame rates, signal integration times, spike frequencies, noise levels. 

Later i will also test how close spike inference methods get at reproducing the the original spike trace, given the above mentioned parameters.
